# Backstage Talks Magazine Landing â€” Replica

In this project, I recreated the landing page of [Backstage Talks Magazine](https://backstagetalks.com/)'s  website. This was a challenge from [Frontend Practice.](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/backstage-talks)  The project involves creating the full-page scroll background transitions & anchor link. The website be mobile responsive. You'll notice there is no full-page scroll on smaller screens.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS.

## Learnings

In this project I learnt a couple of new things, especially CSS and JavaScript animations. The toughest part was recreating the scroll transitions that made the background color change. I also had fun making the scoll snap for each magazine section.
